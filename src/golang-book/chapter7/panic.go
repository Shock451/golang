Functions start with the keyword func, followed by the function's name. The parameters (inputs) of the function are defined like this: name type, name type, â€¦. Our function has one parameter (the list of scores) that we named xs. After the parameters we put the return type. Collectively the parameters and the return type are known as the function's signature.

Finally we have the function body which is a series of statements between curly braces. In this body we invoke a built-in function called panic which causes a run time error. (We'll see more about panic later in this chapter) Writing functions can be difficult so it's a good idea to break the process into manageable chunks, rather than trying to implement the entire thing in one large step.
